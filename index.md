### Pre-requisite

For example to download flexdashboard package:

### Getting Started
1. For creating a flexdashboard, we first need to create a R markdown document. This is done from RStudio New R Markdown dialog:

2. Then select from templates flexdashboard and click ok

3. Now you should see an Rstudio window that looks like this:

4. You can see a base flexboard structure. This can be knit by using Knit drop down dialog and clicking on knit to flex_dashboard

5. After knitting the flexboard structure should appear as follows.

Now that we know how to make a basic flexdashboard, we can make reports on anything.

### FlexDashboard on Transcriptomics data 



### Common Errors:
- Required packages are not installed, so please make sure you don't see an error like this (in red). RStudio should give you shortcut on top to install missing packges.
